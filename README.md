# Install Python

Check to see if you already have Python installed on your system by running:

On a Mac:
`python3 --version`

On Windows:
`python --version`

If you already have Python installed, check to be sure it’s Python 3.8 or up. (For example, 3.11 is great!) We suggest waiting on 3.12 to give any dependencies time to be updated.

If you are using a Windows machine, it is possible that you don’t have Python installed. You’ll need to pause here for a moment and proceed to install it. See this document for more [information](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14diNu_g6uhouBscRt8zIezolANTRQA6HobKRP4Lgu5Q/copy).

# Setting up to run scripts to work with Python.

The scripts in this class can by run with these commands:

On a Mac:
`python3 <filename>`

On Windows:
`python <filename>`

For instance, to run the code in the main.py file the command would be:

On a Mac:
`python3 main.py`

On Windows:
`python main.py`

And to run the solution code:

On a Mac:
`python3 solution.py`

On Windows:
`python solution.py`

Each of the folders has been named for the lesson. So some of the folder names are verrrry long! To make navigating the folders in the command line easier be sure to use the tab key. Start with `cd` and a space. Then type the first few letters of the lessons folder's name and hit the tab key. The remainder of the name should appear. If there's more than one option, continue to tab until the right folder appears.
